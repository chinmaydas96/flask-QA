<br>

<br>From NCBI Gene:
This gene is located in the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome, and expressed specifically in testis. It encodes a protein which has a low degree of similarity to protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 13. Two nearly identical copies of this gene exist within a palindromic region. This record represents the more centromeric copy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

<br>From NCBI Gene:
This gene encodes a sperm tail protein that is highly expressed in adult testis, spermatocytes and spermatids. The protein plays a critical role in the assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. Mutations in this gene result in primary ciliary dyskinesia. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2013]
<br>From UniProt:
Component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), a key regulator of ciliary/flagellar motility which maintains the alignment and integrity of the distal axoneme and regulates microtubule sliding in motile axonemes (By similarity). Plays a critical role in the assembly of N-DRC and also stabilizes the assembly of multiple inner dynein arms and radial spokes. Coassembles with DRC1 to form a central scaffold needed for assembly of the N-DRC and its attachment to the outer doublet microtubules (PubMed:24094744).

<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

<br>From NCBI Gene:
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the calreticulin family, members of which are calcium-binding chaperones localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein is also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, however, its capacity for calcium-binding may be absent or much lower than other family members. This gene is specifically expressed in the testis, and may be required for sperm fertility. Mutation in this gene has been associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]
<br>From UniProt:
During spermatogenesis, may act as a lectin-independent chaperone for specific client proteins such as ADAM3. Required for sperm fertility (By similarity). CALR3 capacity for calcium-binding may be absent or much lower than that of CALR.

<br>From NCBI Gene:
This gene encodes a member of the heat shock protein 40 co-chaperone family which is produced in large amounts in the testis and is located on the radial spokes of the axoneme in human sperm flagella and other flagellar structures. The encoded protein associates with the sperm annulus, as part of the septin complex, through direct interaction with septin 4, during sperm terminal differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia and male infertility. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2017]

Plays a role in the formation of the central complex of ciliary and flagellar axonemes.
