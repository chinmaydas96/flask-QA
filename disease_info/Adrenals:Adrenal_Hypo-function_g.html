The NR0B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called DAX1. This protein plays an important role in the development and function of several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues in the body. These tissues include the small glands located on top of each kidney (the adrenal glands), two hormone-secreting glands in the brain (the hypothalamus and pituitary), and the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). Before birth, the DAX1 protein helps regulate genes that direct the formation of these tissues. DAX1 also helps regulate hormone production in endocrine tissues after they have been formed.

The KCNJ5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a potassium channel, which means that it transports positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium (K+) into and out of cells. Potassium channels produced from the KCNJ5 gene are found in several tissues, including the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In these glands, the flow of ions creates an electrical charge across the cell membrane, which affects the triggering of certain biochemical processes that regulate aldosterone production. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.

<br>Molecular Location :  base pairs 116,372,986 to 116,410,259 on chromosome 1 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

<br>
 Normal Function
<br>

The ATP1A1 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a protein pump known as a Na+/K+ ATPase. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, the protein pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.
Na+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-1 subunit are found in many types of cells, although the pumps appear to play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In the adrenal glands, the flow of sodium and potassium ions helps regulate the production of the hormone aldosterone, which controls blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.

The CACNA1D gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes. The CACNA1D gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV1.3. This subunit forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. CaV1.3 channels are found in many types of cells, although they play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In the adrenal glands, the flow of calcium through CaV1.3 channels appears to help regulate the production of the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. CaV1.3 channels are also found in the brain, heart, and inner ear, although their roles in these tissues are not well understood.

<b><u>MC2R gene</u> : </b>

<br>Molecular Location :  base pairs 13,882,042 to 13,915,707 on chromosome 18 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function
<br>
The MC2R gene provides instructions for making a protein called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. This protein is found primarily in the adrenal glands, which are hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. The ACTH receptor is embedded in the membrane of cells where it attaches (binds) to ACTH. ACTH is a hormone that is released by the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain. The binding of ACTH to its receptor triggers the adrenal glands to produce a group of hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.
The ACTH receptor also likely plays a role in the development of the adrenal glands before birth.

 Normal Function

The CYP11B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. The 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules within cells.
The 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, and helps convert another molecule called 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. These processes are triggered by the release of a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain.
Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from physical stress, and suppresses inflammation. Corticosterone is converted to the hormone aldosterone by the aldosterone synthase enzyme, which is produced from the nearby CYP11B2 gene. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.

The MRAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP). This protein transports another protein, called the melanocortin-2 receptor (or more commonly the adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] receptor), from the interior of the cell to the cell surface. Specifically, the MRAP protein transports the ACTH receptor from a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is involved in protein processing and transport, to the cell membrane so that the receptor can function. The MRAP protein is also needed to turn on (activate) the ACTH receptor.
At the cell membrane, the activated ACTH receptor attaches (binds) to ACTH, which triggers the production of a group of hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body

The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, which is part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in many processes in the body, such as assisting with reactions that break down drugs and helping to produce cholesterol, certain hormones, and fats (lipids).
The 21-hydroxylase enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. 21-hydroxylase plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from stress, and suppresses inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.

Within these hormone-producing tissues, the 3β-HSD enzyme is necessary for the production of many hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, androgens, and estrogen. Cortisol has numerous functions such as maintaining energy and blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidney. The retention of salt affects fluid levels and blood pressure.

The CYP11B2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aldosterone synthase (previously known as corticosterone methyloxidase). This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. Aldosterone synthase is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules within cells.
Aldosterone synthase helps produce a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. The aldosterone synthase enzyme is involved in a series of three chemical reactions that produce aldosterone from other (precursor) molecules: the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, the conversion of corticosterone to 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and the conversion of 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone.
