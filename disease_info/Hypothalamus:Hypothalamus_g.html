LEP gene
Leptin, Which is involved in the regulation of body weight.
Cytogenetic Location: 7q32.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at position 32.1
Molecular Location: base pairs 128,241,201 to 128,257,629 on chromosome 7 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 Normal Function

The LEP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called leptin, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. Normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. As fat accumulates in cells, more leptin is produced. This rise in leptin indicates that fat stores are increasing.
Leptin attaches (binds) to and activates a protein called the leptin receptor, fitting into the receptor like a key into a lock. The leptin receptor protein is found on the surface of cells in many organs and tissues of the body including a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls hunger and thirst as well as other functions such as sleep, moods, and body temperature. It also regulates the release of many hormones that have functions throughout the body. In the hypothalamus, the binding of leptin to its receptor triggers a series of chemical signals that affect hunger and help produce a feeling of fullness (satiety).

MKRN3 gene
makorin ring finger protein 3
This protein plays a role in directing the onset of puberty
Cytogenetic Location: 15q11.2, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 at position 11.2
Molecular Location: base pairs 23,565,307 to 23,568,020 on chromosome 15 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The MKRN3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called makorin ring finger protein 3 (MKRN3). This protein plays a role in directing the onset of puberty, which describes the changes in the body related to sexual development that normally occur in adolescence. Puberty begins when a gland in the brain called the hypothalamus is stimulated to release bursts of a hormone called gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone triggers the release of other hormones that direct sexual development. Research suggests that the MKRN3 protein blocks (inhibits) the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, thus holding off the onset of puberty.
The exact function of the MKRN3 protein is unknown. Based on its structure, the protein is thought to play a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins, called the ubiquitin-proteasome system, by helping attach a molecule called ubiquitin to unwanted proteins. Ubiquitin acts as a signal to the ubiquitin-proteasome system to break the protein down. Researchers speculate that MKRN3 adds ubiquitin to proteins that would otherwise stimulate GnRH release. The breakdown of such proteins ensures that puberty does not begin until the right time.
For most genes, both copies of the gene (one copy inherited from each parent) are active in all cells. However, the activity of the MKRN3 gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. Only the copy inherited from a person's father is active; the copy inherited from the mother is not active. This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.




NR0B1 gene
nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 1 plays an important role in the development and function of several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues in the body.
Cytogenetic Location: Xp21.2, which is the short (p) arm of the X chromosome at position 21.2
Molecular Location: base pairs 30,304,422 to 30,309,378 on the X chromosome (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The NR0B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called DAX1. This protein plays an important role in the development and function of several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues in the body. These tissues include the small glands located on top of each kidney (the adrenal glands), two hormone-secreting glands in the brain (the hypothalamus and pituitary), and the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). Before birth, the DAX1 protein helps regulate genes that direct the formation of these tissues. DAX1 also helps regulate hormone production in endocrine tissues after they have been formed.


GHRL gene
Ghrelin and Obestatin prepropeptide
Hypothalamus which results in the secretion of growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities, including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
ghrelin and obestatin prepropeptide


 Normal Function

From NCBI Gene:
This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities, including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. It was initially proposed that obestatin plays an opposing role to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake, but this action is still debated. Recent reports suggest multiple metabolic roles for obestatin, including regulating adipocyte function and glucose metabolism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. In addition, antisense transcripts for this gene have been identified and may potentially regulate ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein expression. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
From UniProt:
Ghrelin is the ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 (GHSR). Induces the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. Has an appetite-stimulating effect, induces adiposity and stimulates gastric acid secretion. Involved in growth regulation.
Obestatin may be the ligand for GPR39. May have an appetite-reducing effect resulting in decreased food intake. May reduce gastric emptying activity and jejunal motility.

AVP gene
arginine vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
Cytogenetic Location: 20p13, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 20 at position 13
Molecular Location: base pairs 3,082,556 to 3,093,521 on chromosome 20 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The AVP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH starts out as a larger molecule called a preprohormone, which is cut (cleaved) and modified to produce the active hormone and several related proteins. The preprohormone is made in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then transported to the nearby pituitary gland, where active ADH is stored until it is needed.
The major function of ADH is to help control the body's water balance by determining how much water is excreted in urine. Normally, when a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the pituitary gland releases more ADH into the bloodstream. High levels of this hormone direct the kidneys to reabsorb more water and to make less urine. When fluid intake is adequate, the pituitary gland releases less ADH. Lower levels of this hormone cause the kidneys to reabsorb less water and to make more urine.

 GH1 gene
growth hormone 1, gene provides instructions for making the growth hormone protein.  
Cytogenetic Location: 17q23.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 at position 23.3
Molecular Location: base pairs 63,917,193 to 63,918,852 on chromosome 17 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

The GH1 gene provides instructions for making the growth hormone protein. Growth hormone is produced in the growth-stimulating somatotropic cells of the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. Growth hormone is necessary for the normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The production of growth hormone is triggered when two other hormones are turned on (activated): ghrelin, which is produced in the stomach; and growth hormone releasing hormone, which is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Ghrelin and growth hormone releasing hormone also stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. The release of growth hormone into the body peaks during puberty and reaches a low point at about age 55.
Cells in the liver respond to growth hormone and trigger the production of a protein called insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). This protein stimulates cell growth and cell maturation (differentiation) in many different tissues, including bone. The production of IGF-I by the actions of growth hormone is a major contributor to the promotion of growth.
Growth hormone also plays a role in many chemical reactions (metabolic processes) in the body. By acting on specific tissues, growth hormone is involved in protein production and the breakdown (metabolism) of fats and carbohydrates. 

HLA-DQB1 gene
The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.

major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1
Cytogenetic Location: 6p21.32, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 6 at position 21.32
Molecular Location: base pairs 32,659,464 to 32,666,689 on chromosome 6 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
 
 Normal Function

The HLA-DQB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQB1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.
The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. The HLA-DQB1 gene belongs to a group of MHC genes called MHC class II. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of certain immune system cells. These proteins attach to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. MHC class II proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.
The protein produced from the HLA-DQB1 gene attaches (binds) to the protein produced from another MHC class II gene, HLA-DQA1. Together, they form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQαβ heterodimer. This complex displays foreign peptides to the immune system to trigger the body's immune response.
Each MHC class II gene has many possible variations, allowing the immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Researchers have identified hundreds of different versions (alleles) of the HLA-DQB1 gene, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-DQB1*06:02). 

TRH gene
thyrotropin releasing hormone
Cytogenetic Location: 3q22.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position 22.1
Molecular Location: base pairs 129,974,393 to 129,977,938 on chromosome 3 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

 Normal Function

From NCBI Gene:
This gene encodes a member of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone family. Cleavage of the encoded proprotein releases mature thyrotropin-releasing hormone, which is a tripeptide hypothalamic regulatory hormone. The human proprotein contains six thyrotropin-releasing hormone tripeptides. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is involved in the regulation and release of thyroid-stimulating hormone, as well as prolactin. Deficiency of this hormone has been associated with hypothalamic hypothyroidism. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]
From UniProt:
As a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, it controls the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and is involved in thyroid hormone synthesis regulation. It also operates as modulator of hair growth. It promotes hair-shaft elongation, prolongs the hair cycle growth phase (anagen) and antagonizes its termination (catagen) by TGFB2. It stimulates proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of hair matrix keratinocytes.
