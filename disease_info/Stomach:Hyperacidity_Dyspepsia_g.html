Gene provides instructions for making a protein called mucolipin-1. This protein is located in the membranes of lysosomes and endosomes, compartments within the cell that digest and recycle materials. While its function is not completely understood, mucolipin-1 plays a role in the transport (trafficking) of fats (lipids) and proteins between lysosomes and endosomes.
Mucolipin-1 acts as a channel, allowing positively charged atoms (cations) to cross the membranes of lysosomes and endosomes. It remains unclear which cations are allowed to flow through this channel. Mucolipin-1 appears to be important for the development and maintenance of the brain and light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). In addition, this protein is likely critical for normal functioning of the cells in the stomach that produce digestive acids.

This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities, including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. It was initially proposed that obestatin plays and opposing role to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake, but this action is still debated. Recent reports suggest multiple metabolic roles for obestatin, including regulating adipocyte function and glucose metabolism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. In addition, antisense transcripts for this gene have been identified and may potentially regulate ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein expression. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]
From UniProt:
Ghrelin is the ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 (GHSR). Induces the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. Has an appetite-stimulating effect, induces adiposity and stimulates gastric acid secretion. Involved in growth regulation.
Obestatin may be the ligand for GPR39. May have an appetite-reducing effect resulting in decreased food intake. May reduce gastric emptying activity and jejunal motility.


<u><b>GH1 gene
growth hormone 1
. Ghrelin and growth hormone releasing hormone also stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland

<br><br>Normal Function :
<br>

The GH1 gene provides instructions for making the growth hormone protein. Growth hormone is produced in the growth-stimulating somatotropic cells of the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. Growth hormone is necessary for the normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The production of growth hormone is triggered when two other hormones are turned on (activated): ghrelin, which is produced in the stomach; and growth hormone releasing hormone, which is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Ghrelin and growth hormone releasing hormone also stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. The release of growth hormone into the body peaks during puberty and reaches a low point at about age 55.
Cells in the liver respond to growth hormone and trigger the production of a protein called insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). This protein stimulates cell growth and cell maturation (differentiation) in many different tissues, including bone. The production of IGF-I by the actions of growth hormone is a major contributor to the promotion of growth.
Growth hormone also plays a role in many chemical reactions (metabolic processes) in the body. By acting on specific tissues, growth hormone is involved in protein production and the breakdown (metabolism) of fats and carbohydrates.

 provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing (contraction) of muscles.
Smooth muscle α-2 actin is found in smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscles line the internal organs, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines. Within smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle α-2 actin forms the core of structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to contract. Smooth muscles contract and relax as part of their normal function without being consciously controlled.
Layers of smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of the arteries, which are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Smooth muscle α-2 actin contributes to the ability of these muscles to contract, which allows the arteries to maintain their shape instead of stretching out as blood is pumped through them.

<u><b>MYH11

<br><br>Normal Function :
<br>

The MYH11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11. It belongs to a group of proteins called myosins, which are involved in cell movement and the transport of materials within and between cells. Thick filaments made of myosin, along with thin filaments of another protein called actin, are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle tensing (contraction). Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11 forms part of a myosin protein complex found in smooth muscles. Smooth muscles are the muscles that line the internal organs of the body, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines; as part of their normal function in the body, these muscles contract and relax involuntarily.
Each myosin protein complex consists of two pairs of light chains, which regulate the complex and are produced from several other genes, and two heavy chains such as that produced from the MYH11 gene. The heavy chains each have two parts: a head region and a tail region. The head region interacts with actin and includes a segment that attaches (binds) to ATP. ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for the cells' activities, including muscle contraction. The long tail region of the myosin heavy chain interacts with other proteins, including the tail regions of other myosins, enabling them to form thick filaments.

The calpains, calcium-activated neutral proteases, are nonlysosomal, intracellular cysteine proteases. The mammalian calpains include ubiquitous, stomach-specific, and muscle-specific proteins. The ubiquitous enzymes consist of heterodimers with distinct large, catalytic subunits associated with a common small, regulatory subunit. This gene encodes the large subunit of the ubiquitous enzyme, calpain 1. Several transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]

This gene is a member of the telombin family and encodes a nuclear protein involved in telomere maintenance. Specifically, this protein functions as a member of a multi-protein complex that binds to the TTAGGG repeats of telomeres, regulating telomere length and protecting chromosome ends from illegitimate recombination, catastrophic chromosome instability, and abnormal chromosome segregation. Increased transcriptional expression of this gene is associated with stomach carcinogenesis and its progression. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
From UniProt:
Component of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that is essential for the replication of chromosome termini. Is a component of the double-stranded telomeric DNA-binding TRF1 complex which is involved in the regulation of telomere length by cis-inhibition of telomerase. Also acts as a single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein and thus may act as a downstream effector of the TRF1 complex and may transduce information about telomere maintenance and/or length to the telomere terminus. Component of the shelterin complex (telosome) that is involved in the regulation of telomere length and protection. Shelterin associates with arrays of double-stranded TTAGGG repeats added by telomerase and protects chromosome ends; without its protective activity, telomeres are no longer hidden from the DNA damage surveillance and chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways. Binds to two or more telomeric single-stranded 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats (G-strand) and with high specificity to a minimal telomeric single-stranded 5'-TAGGGTTAG-3' sequence. Binds telomeric single-stranded sequences internally or at proximity of a 3'-end. Its activity is TERT dependent but it does not increase TERT activity by itself. In contrast, the ACD-POT1 heterodimer enhances telomere elongation by increasing telomerase processivity.

gene provides instructions for making a protein called platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The PDGFRA protein is found in the cell membrane of certain cell types where a specific protein, called platelet-derived growth factor, attaches (binds) to it. This binding turns on (activates) the PDGFRA protein, which then activates other proteins inside the cell by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions (a process called phosphorylation). This process leads to the activation of a series of proteins in multiple signaling pathways.
The signaling pathways stimulated by the PDGFRA protein control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. PDGFRA protein signaling is important for the development of many types of cells throughout the body.
Mutations in the PDGFRA gene are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). GISTs are a type of tumor that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. The majority of GISTs associated with a mutation in the PDGFRAgene occur in the stomach. In most cases, the genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are called somatic mutations. Somatic mutations, which lead to sporadic GISTs, are present only in the tumor cells and are not inherited. Less commonly, PDGFRA gene mutations that increase the risk of developing GISTs are inherited from a parent, which can lead to familial GISTs.
PDGFRA gene mutations associated with GISTs create a protein that no longer requires binding of the platelet-derived growth factor protein to be activated. As a result, the PDGFRA protein and the signaling pathways are constitutively activated, which increases cell proliferation and survival, leading to tumor formation.

  This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located primarily in the nucleus of cells, where it helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. This protein also plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and the immune system. Additionally, the ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands. DNA can be damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals or radiation. Breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division. The ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information.
Because of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is of great interest in cancer research. Research suggests that people who carry one mutated copy of the ATM gene in each cell may have an increased risk of developing several other types of cancer. In particular, some studies have shown that cancers of the breast, stomach, bladder, pancreas, lung, and ovaries occur more frequently in ATM mutation carriers than in people who do not carry these mutations. The results of similar studies, however, have been conflicting. Additional research is needed to clarify which other types of cancer, if any, are associated with ATM mutations.

  gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase 1. This enzyme is involved in DNA methylation, which is the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to DNA molecules. In particular, the enzyme helps add methyl groups to DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called cytosines.
DNA methylation is important in many cellular functions. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out or suppressed (gene silencing), regulating reactions involving proteins and fats (lipids), and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters). DNA methyltransferase 1 is active in the adult nervous system. Although its specific function is not well understood, the enzyme may help regulate nerve cell (neuron) maturation and specialization (differentiation), the ability of neurons to move (migrate) and connect with each other, and neuron survival. Several normal variations (polymorphisms) in the DNMT1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of cancer, including cancers of the breast and stomach. These variations, which are found in cells throughout the body and can be passed on from parent to child, may affect the activity of the DNA methyltransferase 1 enzyme and its role in gene silencing. Changes in the silencing of particular genes can lead to abnormal cell growth and division and increase the risk of cancer.
In addition, increased activity (overexpression) of the DNMT1 gene has been identified in certain brain cancers called gliomas. The genetic changes involved in this overexpression are somatic, which means that they occur only in the tumor cells and are not inherited. Researchers suggest that overexpression of the DNMT1 gene may result in methylation and silencing of genes called tumor suppressors. When tumor suppressor genes are silenced, cells can grow and divide unchecked, which can lead to cancer.
