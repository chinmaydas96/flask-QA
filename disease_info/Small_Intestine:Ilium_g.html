This  gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lactase. This enzyme helps to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products.  Lactase is produced by cells that line the walls of the small intestine. These cells, called intestinal epithelial cells, have finger-like projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine so they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border. Lactase functions at the brush border to break down lactose into smaller sugars called glucose and galactose for absorption. At least nine LCT gene mutations cause congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia. In this disorder, infants are unable to break down lactose (lactose intolerance) in breast milk or formula. The LCT gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the lactase enzyme or result in an enzyme that is abnormally short. The mutations are believed to interfere with the function of the lactase enzyme, leading to undigested lactose in the small intestine and causing severe diarrhea.Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity (expression) of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein called amnionless. This protein is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) from food. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).
The amnionless protein is primarily found embedded in the outer membrane of kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Amnionless attaches (binds) to another protein called cubilin, anchoring cubilin to the cell membrane. Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the intestine or kidneys. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidneys, amnionless and cubilin are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.

This  gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin Vb. This protein is one of a group of proteins with similar structures called myosins, which are involved in cell movement and the transport of materials within and between cells. Myosin Vb helps to determine the position of various components within cells (cell polarity). Myosin Vb also plays a role in moving components from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell for recycling More than 40 mutations in the MYO5B gene have been found to cause microvillus inclusion disease. This condition is characterized by chronic, life-threatening diarrhea beginning in infancy. The MYO5B gene mutations that cause this condition result in a decrease or absence of myosin Vb function. In cells that line the small intestine (enterocytes), a lack of myosin Vb function changes the cell polarity. As a result, enterocytes cannot properly form structures called microvilli, which normally project like small fingers from the surface of the cells and absorb nutrients and fluids from food as it passes through the intestine. Inside affected enterocytes, small clumps of abnormal microvilli mix with misplaced digestive proteins to form microvillus inclusions, which contribute to the dysfunction of enterocytes. Disorganized enterocytes with poorly formed microvilli reduce the intestine's ability to take in nutrients and fluids. The inability to absorb nutrients and fluids during digestion leads to severe diarrhea, malnutrition, and dehydration in individuals with microvillus inclusion disease.

This gene provides instructions for making sterolin-1, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin. The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-2, is produced from a gene called ABCG8. Sterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells.
Sterolin is a transporter protein, which is a type of protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols. After plant sterols are absorbed from food into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract. Sterolin transporters in liver cells pump the plant sterols into a fluid called bile that is released into the intestine. From the intestine, the plant sterols are eliminated with the feces. This process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream. Sterolin also helps regulate levels of cholesterol, another fatty substance found in animal products, in a similar fashion; normally about 50 percent of cholesterol in the diet is absorbed by the body.  Certain normal variations (polymorphisms) in the ABCG5 gene are associated with an increased risk of gallstones, which are small pebble-like deposits in the gallbladder or the bile ducts. Bile ducts carry bile (a fluid that helps digest fats) from the liver, where bile is produced, to the gallbladder, where it is stored, and to the small intestine, where it aids in digestion. Researchers suggest that the ABCG5 gene changes that increase the risk of gallstones may result in a sterolin transporter protein that pumps more cholesterol than usual into bile. This leads to the presence of more cholesterol than can be dissolved in the bile fluid in the bile ducts and gallbladder, resulting in the formation of gallstones.

  gene provides instructions for making a protein called ferroportin. This protein is involved in the process of iron absorption in the body. Iron from the diet is absorbed through the walls of the small intestine. Ferroportin then transports iron from the small intestine into the bloodstream, and the iron is carried by the blood to the tissues and organs of the body. Ferroportin also transports iron out of specialized immune system cells (called reticuloendothelial cells) that are found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The amount of iron absorbed by the body depends on the amount of iron stored and released from intestinal and reticuloendothelial cells.
Research suggests that the amount of ferroportin available to transport iron out of cells is controlled by another iron regulatory protein, hepcidin. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin and causes it to be broken down when the body's iron supplies are adequate. When the body is lacking iron, hepcidin levels drop and more ferroportin is available to bring iron into the body and to release it from storage. Researchers have identified approximately 15 mutations in the SLC40A1 gene that cause a form of hereditary hemochromatosis called ferroportin disease, which is also sometimes referred to as type 4 hemochromatosis. Almost all of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in ferroportin. Abnormal versions of ferroportin do not permit the normal transport and release of iron from intestinal or reticuloendothelial cells. As a result, the regulation of iron levels in the body is impaired and iron overload results. One mutated copy of this gene in each cell is sufficient to cause ferroportin disease.

This  protein is needed for the transport of molecules called chylomicrons. During digestion, chylomicrons are formed within cells called enterocytes that line the small intestine and absorb nutrients. Chylomicrons are needed to absorb fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins K, E, and D) and carry fats and cholesterol from the small intestine into the bloodstream.
Within enterocytes, SAR1B proteins help transport immature chylomicrons from a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum to another cell structure called the Golgi apparatus. Immature chylomicrons are processed within the Golgi apparatus, resulting in mature chylomicrons. These mature chylomicrons are then released from enterocytes into the bloodstream so the body can use the fats and fat-soluble vitamins they carry. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth and development.
In other tissues, such as the heart and other muscles, the SAR1B protein is likely involved in transporting calcium within cells.  More than 20 mutations in the SAR1B gene have been found to cause chylomicron retention disease. This is an inherited disorder that impairs the normal absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from food. Most of the mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the SAR1B protein. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the protein that cannot function properly.
SAR1B gene mutations disrupt the SAR1B protein's ability to transport immature chylomicrons from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. As a result, mature chylomicrons are not released into the bloodstream.

This condition is characterized by abnormal development of epithelial cells in the intestines. In this condition, the villi, which are small finger-like projections that line the small intestine, are abnormal. In particular, they have "tufts" of extra epithelial cells on their tips. Normally, these projections provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. The altered villi are less able to absorb nutrients and fluids than normal tissue, which causes life-threatening diarrhea and poor growth. Congenital tufting enteropathy develops in newborns within days of birth and lasts throughout life. EPCAM gene mutations involved in this condition lead to the loss of functional EpCAM protein. The resulting loss of EpICD signaling leads to abnormal development of intestinal epithelial cells, causing congenital tufting enteropathy.

In the cells of the body, riboflavin is the core component of molecules called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN). These molecules function as coenzymes, which means they help enzymes carry out chemical reactions. FAD and FMN are involved in many different chemical reactions and are required for a variety of cellular processes. One important role of these coenzymes is in the production of energy for cells. FAD and FMN are also involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

  gene provides instructions for the production of a protein called hepcidin. Hepcidin was originally identified as having antimicrobial properties, which refers to the ability of this protein to fight bacterial infections. Researchers have discovered that hepcidin plays a major role in maintaining iron balance in the body. They believe that hepcidin circulates in the blood and inhibits iron absorption by the small intestine when the body's supply of iron is too high. Researchers have proposed that hepcidin production in the liver increases when iron enters liver cells from the blood. Hepcidin is then released into the bloodstream and travels throughout the body. This protein interacts primarily with other proteins in the intestines, liver, and certain white blood cells to adjust iron absorption and storage. In this way, iron supplies are monitored and iron absorption is adjusted to reflect the needs of an individual's body. At least eight mutations in the HAMP gene can cause hereditary hemochromatosis. People who have mutations in the HAMP gene are affected by a severe type of juvenile hemochromatosis, sometimes called type 2 hemochromatosis, that begins between the ages of 10 years and 30 years. People with mutations in the HAMP gene are unable to make normal hepcidin and cannot inhibit iron absorption, even when the body has sufficient supplies of iron. The organs of affected people become overloaded with iron, especially the liver and the heart, leading to the organ damage characteristic of this disorder.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is required for a process called autophagy. Cells use this process to recycle worn-out cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. Autophagy also plays an important role in controlled cell death (apoptosis). Additionally, autophagy is involved in the body's inflammatory response and helps the immune system destroy some types of harmful bacteria and viruses. At least one variation in the ATG16L1 gene is associated with an increased risk of Crohn disease, particularly a form of the disorder that affects the lower part of the small intestine (the ileum) and the colon. This increased risk has been found primarily in people of northern European ancestry. The identified ATG16L1 variation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of the ATG16L1 protein. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid alanine at protein position 300 (written as Thr300Ala or T300A).
This change in the ATG16L1 gene impairs the autophagy process, allowing worn-out cell parts and harmful bacteria to persist when they would otherwise be destroyed. These cell components and bacteria may trigger an inappropriate immune system

This enzyme is found in the intestinal tract, where it is involved in breaking down the sugars sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains). Sucrose and maltose are called disaccharides because they are each made up of two simple sugar molecules. Disaccharides must be broken down into simple sugar molecules to be digested properly.
The sucrase-isomaltase enzyme is found on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells, which are cells that line the walls of the intestine. These cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine.

The protein encoded by this gene is a multi-pass membrane protein. It contains a conserved N-terminal Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) domain and a putative sterol-sensing domain (SSD) which includes a YQRL motif functioning as a plasma membrane to trans-Golgi network transport signal in other proteins. This protein takes up free cholesterol into cells through vesicular endocytosis and plays a critical role in the absorption of intestinal cholesterol. It also has the ability to transport alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E). The drug ezetimibe targets this protein and inhibits the absorption of intestinal cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol. In addition, this protein may play a critical role in regulating lipid metabolism.

<br>

The ATP7A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for regulating copper levels in the body. Copper is necessary for many cellular functions, but it is toxic when present in excessive amounts. The ATP7A protein is found throughout the body, except in liver cells. In the small intestine, this protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the ATP7A protein has a dual role and shuttles between two cellular locations. The protein normally resides in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, the ATP7A protein supplies copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. If copper levels in the cell environment are elevated, however, the ATP7A protein moves to the cell membrane and eliminates excess copper from the cell.
The TMPRSS6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called matriptase-2. This protein is part of a signaling pathway that controls the levels of another protein called hepcidin, which is a key regulator of iron balance in the body. When blood iron levels are low, this signaling pathway reduces hepcidin production, allowing more iron from the diet to be absorbed through the intestines and transported out of storage sites (particularly in the liver and spleen) into the bloodstream. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen.

<br>From NCBI Gene:
This gene encodes a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular weight of 76.5 kDa. It is thought to have been created as a result of an ancient gene duplication event that led to generation of homologous C and N-terminal domains each of which binds one ion of ferric iron. The function of this protein is to transport iron from the intestine, reticuloendothelial system, and liver parenchymal cells to all proliferating cells in the body. This protein may also have a physiologic role as granulocyte/pollen-binding protein (GPBP) involved in the removal of certain organic matter and allergens from serum. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]
<br>From UniProt:
Transferrins are iron binding transport proteins which can bind two Fe(3+) ions in association with the binding of an anion, usually bicarbonate. It is responsible for the transport of iron from sites of absorption and heme degradation to those of storage and utilization. Serum transferrin may also have a further role in stimulating cell proliferation.

alpha tocopherol transfer protein
Vitamin E absorption

<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The TTPA gene provides instructions for making the α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which is found in the liver and brain. This protein controls the distribution of vitamin E obtained from the diet (also called α-tocopherol) to cells and tissues throughout the body. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cells in the body from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. Normally, vitamin E derived from food is absorbed in the intestine and then transported into the liver on molecules called chylomicrons. After a meal, chylomicrons are formed to transport fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin E), dietary fats, and cholesterol from the intestine to the liver. Once in the liver, αTTP transfers vitamin E from chylomicrons to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), which carry fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol from the liver to other tissues throughout the body. The VLDLs are then released into the bloodstream so the accompanying vitamin E can be used in the body. The αTTP protein is also thought to transport vitamin E to nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.

serine protease 1
TRIPSINOGINE
<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The PRSS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cationic trypsinogen. This enzyme is a serine peptidase, which is a type of enzyme that cuts (cleaves) other proteins into smaller pieces. Cationic trypsinogen is produced in the pancreas and helps with the digestion of food. Cationic trypsinogen is secreted by the pancreas and transported to the small intestine, where it is cleaved to form trypsinogen. When the enzyme is needed, trypsinogen is cleaved again into its working (active) form called trypsin. Trypsin aids in digestion by cutting protein chains at the protein building blocks (amino acids) arginine or lysine, which breaks down the protein. Trypsin also turns on (activates) other digestive enzymes that are produced in the pancreas to further facilitate digestion.
A particular region of trypsin is attached (bound) to a calcium molecule. As long as trypsin is bound to calcium, the enzyme is protected from being broken down. When digestion is complete and trypsin is no longer needed, the calcium molecule is removed from the enzyme, which allows trypsin to be broken down.

<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The SERPINA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, which is a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins help control several types of chemical reactions by blocking (inhibiting) the activity of certain enzymes. Alpha-1 antitrypsin prevents the digestive enzyme trypsin from breaking down proteins until trypsin reaches the intestines. Alpha-1 antitrypsin also inhibits other enzymes, including a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase that is released from white blood cells to fight infection.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin protects the lungs from neutrophil elastase, which can damage lung tissue if not properly controlled. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is produced in the liver and then transported to the lungs via the blood.

<u><b>APOB gene</u>:</b>
Apolipoprotein B-48 is produced in the intestine and makes chylomicrons.

Chylomicrons
apolipoprotein B

<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The APOB gene provides instructions for making two versions of the apolipoprotein B protein, a short version called apolipoprotein B-48 and a longer version known as apolipoprotein B-100. Both of these proteins are components of lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood.
Apolipoprotein B-48 is produced in the intestine, where it is a building block of a type of lipoprotein called a chylomicron. As food is digested after a meal, chylomicrons are formed to carry fat and cholesterol from the intestine into the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin A.
Apolipoprotein B-100, which is produced in the liver, is a component of several other types of lipoproteins. Specifically, this protein is a building block of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). These related molecules all transport fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream.
Low-density lipoproteins are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Apolipoprotein B-100 allows these particles to attach to specific receptors on the surface of cells, particularly in the liver. The receptors transport low-density lipoproteins into the cell, where they are broken down to release cholesterol. The cholesterol is then used by the cell, stored, or removed from the body.

Versatile protein that is involved in regulation of different cellular pathways implicated in membrane trafficking. Involved in regulation of the COPI-dependent retrograde transport from Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum by associating with the NRZ complex; the function is dependent on its binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) (PubMed:24056303). During autophagy acts as regulatory subunit of the alternative PI3K complex II (PI3KC3-C2) that mediates formation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and is believed to be involved in maturation of autophagosomes and endocytosis. Activates lipid kinase activity of PIK3C3. Involved in the regulation of degradative endocytic trafficking and cytokinesis, and in regulation of ATG9A transport from the Golgi to the autophagosome; the functions seems to implicate its association with PI3KC3-C2 (PubMed:16799551, PubMed:20643123, PubMed:24056303). Involved in maturation of autophagosomes and degradative endocytic trafficking independently of BECN1 but depending on its association with a class C Vps complex (possibly the HOPS complex); the association is also proposed to promote autophagosome recruitment and activation of Rab7 and endosome-endosome fusion events (PubMed:18552835). Enhances class C Vps complex (possibly HOPS complex) association with a SNARE complex and promotes fusogenic SNARE complex formation during late endocytic membrane fusion (PubMed:24550300). In case of negative-strand RNA virus infection is required for efficient virus entry, promotes endocytic transport of virions and is implicated in a VAMP8-specific fusogenic SNARE complex assembly (PubMed:24550300).

The protein encoded by this gene is a P1-P3-bis(5'-adenosyl) triphosphate hydrolase involved in purine metabolism. This gene encompasses the common fragile site FRA3B on chromosome 3, where carcinogen-induced damage can lead to translocations and aberrant transcripts. In fact, aberrant transcripts from this gene have been found in about half of all esophageal, stomach, and colon carcinomas. The encoded protein is also a tumor suppressor, as loss of its activity results in replication stress and DNA damage. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]
<br>From UniProt:
Cleaves P(1)-P(3)-bis(5'-adenosyl) triphosphate (Ap3A) to yield AMP and ADP. Can also hydrolyze P(1)-P(4)-bis(5'-adenosyl) tetraphosphate (Ap4A), but has extremely low activity with ATP. Modulates transcriptional activation by CTNNB1 and thereby contributes to regulate the expression of genes essential for cell proliferation and survival, such as CCND1 and BIRC5. Plays a role in the induction of apoptosis via SRC and AKT1 signaling pathways. Inhibits MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53/TP53 and thereby plays a role in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis depends on the ability of FHIT to bind P(1)-P(3)-bis(5'-adenosyl) triphosphate or related compounds, but does not require its catalytic activity, it may in part come from the mitochondrial form, which sensitizes the low-affinity Ca(2+) transporters, enhancing mitochondrial calcium uptake. Functions as tumor suppressor.

Associated with digestive tract cancers. Numerous tumor types are found to have aberrant forms of FHIT protein due to deletions in a coding region of chromosome 3p14.2 including the fragile site locus FRA3B.
A chromosomal aberration involving FHIT has been found in a lymphoblastoid cell line established from a family with renal cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma. Translocation t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1) with RNF139. Although the 3p14.2 breakpoint has been shown to interrupt FHIT in its 5-prime non-coding region, it is unlikely that FHIT is causally related to renal or other malignancies.

The ZEB2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many organs and tissues before birth. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Researchers have found that the ZEB2 protein is involved in chemical signaling pathways that regulate early growth and development.
The ZEB2 protein is active in many types of cells before birth. It appears to be particularly important for the development of the neural crest, which is a group of cells in the early embryo that give rise to many tissues and organs. Neural crest cells migrate to form portions of the nervous system, glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), pigment cells, smooth muscle and other tissues in the heart, and many tissues in the face and skull.
The ZEB2 protein is also active in cells that are not derived from the neural crest. For example, this protein is involved in the development of the digestive tract, skeletal muscles, kidneys, and other organs.
