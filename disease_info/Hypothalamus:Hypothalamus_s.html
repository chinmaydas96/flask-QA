1. Porcine hypothalamus cytosol- The desiccated Hypothalamus from pigs helps aid in the functions of our own. Thymus and spleen extracts have putative immunomodulatory activities. 
<br>
2. DHEA- A natural substance produced in the adrenal glands, gonads, and brain. A steroid prohormone and precursor for both androgens and estrogens. 
*   5mg 1x daily
<br>
3. Ashwagandha- A powerful adaptogenic herb that helps regulate hormones such as cortisol, ACTH, and Ghrelin. 
*   600mg 1x daily
<br>
4. Chromium Picolonate- A trace mineral that increases hypothalamus activity through the peptide bonds. Also lowers ghrelin hormones and helps to balance leptin levels. 
*   200mcg 1 daily
<br>
5. Chaste berry Vitex- Acts directly on the hypothalamus and pituitary. Modulates prolactin levels and release of FSH. This balances the progesterone and estrogen ratios. 
*   500mg 2x daily
<br>
6. GABA- The major inhibitory neurotransmitter highly concentrated in the hypothalamus that lowers cortisol and regulates prolactin and Growth hormone. If GABA levels are low, seizures and other neurological disorders may occur.  GABA deficiencies negatively affect the other functions in the hypothalamus. 
*   400mg 1x before bed or 200mg 2x daily
<br>
7. Taurine- A nonprotein amino acid. Involved in the pre and post-natal development of the central nervous system and visual system. A positive modulator of GABA. Taurine has been shown to prevent the neuronal damage that can occur when there is an exposure to increased levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. 
*   1,500mg 1x daily with breakfast
<br>
8. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5-phosphate)- This form is a coenzyme for over 100 enzymes. It is necessary for amino acid metabolism as well as GABA. Deficiency in B6 leads to pellagra, and contributes to dysfunction of the limbic system. It is also required in the methylation cycle that is necessary for continuation of other components that play a role in the hypothalamus. 
*   15mg 2x daily
<br>
9. 5-HTP- A neuromodulator that is widely distributed throughout the brain and generally enhances GABA and therefore has inhibitory activity. Peripheral decarboxylation of 5-HTP occurs to a much lesser extent in those with low B6, and most likely to a greater extent in those who take concurrent B6 supplements. 
*   50mg 1x before bed
<br>
10. Glutamine- Glutamine is an amino acid and a common precursor for the biosynthesis of GABA and glutamate. Significant quantities of glutamine are normally present in the brain to support the complex process of GABA synthesis. Those with high Glutamate levels should not supplement with Glutamine.
*   5g before bed
