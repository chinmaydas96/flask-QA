    The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from primitive foregut. Unlike the posterior lobe, which is neural tissue, the anterior lobe is primarily a collection of endocrine cells. The anterior pituitary secretes 6 peptide hormones. The nature of the relationship between the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary is both neural and endocrine (in contrast to the posterior lobe, which is only neural). The hypothalamus and anterior pituitary are linked directly to the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood vessels which provide most of the blood supply to the anterior lobe. 


   THS(thyroid stimulating hormone)- Stimulates synthesis and            secretion of thyroid hormones


    FSH (follicle stimulating hormone)- Stimulates sperm maturation in Sertoli cells of testes and follicular development and estrogen synthesis in ovaries.


    LH (luteinizing hormone)- Stimulates testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells of testes. Stimulates ovulation, formation of corpus luteum, estrogen, and progesterone in ovaries. 


    GH (growth hormone)- Synthesized in the somatotrophs of the anterior lobe of the pituitary also known as somatotropin. 


    Prolactin- Stimulates milk production and secretion in breast and inhibits its own secretion by increasing the synthesis of dopamine from the hypothalamus. 


    ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)- Stimulates synthesis and secretion of adrenal cortical hormones such as cortisol, androgens, and aldosterone.


    MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone)- Stimulates melanin synthesis


    **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Posterior Pituitary</span>**: 


    The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from neural tissue. It secretes 2 peptide hormones which act on their respective tissues- the kidney, the breast, and the uterus. The connections between the hypothalamus and the posterior lobe of the pituitary are neural. In fact, the posterior pituitary is a collection of nerve axons whose cell bodies are located in the hypothalamus. Thus, the hormones secreted by the posterior lobe are actually neuro peptides. 


    Oxytocin- Stimulates milk ejection from breasts and uterine contractions. The cell bodies of oxytocin neurons are contained primarily in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. 


    ADH (vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone)- Stimulates water reabsorption in principal cells of collecting ducts and constriction of arterioles. The cell bodies of ADH neurons are contained primarily in the supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus.
