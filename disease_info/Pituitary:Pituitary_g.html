The PROP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the activity of many other genes. On the basis of this action, the PROP1 protein is known as a transcription factor. This protein is found only in the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland releases hormones needed for growth, reproduction, and other critical body functions. The PROP1 protein helps in the specialization (differentiation) of cell types within the pituitary gland.

The GHRHR gene provides instructions for making the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor. This receptor is active (expressed) on the growth-stimulating somatotropic cells in the pituitary gland. This gland is is located at the base of the brain and produces many hormones, including growth hormone. Growth hormone is necessary for the normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The GHRHR receptor attaches (binds) to a molecule called growth hormone releasing hormone. This binding, along with the actions of other molecules, triggers the production of growth hormone and its release from the pituitary gland.

<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

The GPR101 gene provides instructions for making a type of protein called a G protein-coupled receptor. G protein-coupled receptors are embedded in the outer membrane of cells, where they relay chemical signals from outside the cell to the interior of the cell. However, the specific function of the GPR101 protein is unknown. The protein is found primarily in the brain, and studies suggest that it has a role in the pituitary gland. This gland, located at the base of the brain, produces hormones that control many important body functions. One of these hormones, called growth hormone, helps direct normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The GPR101 protein is predominantly expressed in the pituitary gland during development before birth and again at adolescence, stages when the body grows the most. The protein is thought to be involved in the growth of cells in the pituitary gland, in the release of growth hormone from the gland, or in both processes.

<br><br> Normal Function : <br>

<br>From NCBI Gene:
This gene encodes a receptor for the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin, and belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Prolactin-dependent signaling occurs as the result of ligand-induced dimerization of the prolactin receptor. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different membrane-bound and soluble isoforms have been described for this gene, which may function to modulate the endocrine and autocrine effects of prolactin in normal tissue and cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]
<br>From UniProt:
This is a receptor for the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL). Acts as a prosurvival factor for spermatozoa by inhibiting sperm capacitation through suppression of SRC kinase activation and stimulation of AKT. Isoform 4 is unable to transduce prolactin signaling. Isoform 6 is unable to transduce prolactin signaling.

<br>From NCBI Gene:
This gene is a member of the glycoprotein hormone beta chain family and encodes the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH). Glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers consisting of a common alpha subunit and an unique beta subunit which confers biological specificity. LH is expressed in the pituitary gland and promotes spermatogenesis and ovulation by stimulating the testes and ovaries to synthesize steroids. The genes for the beta chains of chorionic gonadotropin and for luteinizing hormone are contiguous on chromosome 19q13.3. Mutations in this gene are associated with hypogonadism which is characterized by infertility and pseudohermaphroditism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

<br>From NCBI Gene:
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the sulfotransferase 2 family. It is predominantly expressed in the pituitary gland, and is localized to the golgi membrane. This protein catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in both N-glycans and O-glycans. It is responsible for sulfation of GalNAc on luteinizing hormone (LH), which is required for production of the sex hormones. Mice lacking this enzyme, exhibit increased levels of circulating LH, and precocious sexual maturation of both male and female mice. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]
<br>From UniProt:
Catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in both N-glycans and O-glycans. Required for biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin, by mediating sulfation of their carbohydrate structures. Only active against terminal GalNAcbeta1,GalNAcbeta. Not active toward chondroitin.
