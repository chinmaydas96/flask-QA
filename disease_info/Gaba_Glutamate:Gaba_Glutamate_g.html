The GABRA1 gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha-1 (α1) subunit, of the GABAA receptor protein. GABAA receptors are made up of different combinations of five protein subunits, each produced from a different gene. (Nineteen different genes provide instructions for GABAA receptor subunits.) These subunits form a hole (pore) in the cell membrane through which negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) can flow.
A chemical that transmits signals in the brain (a neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) attaches to GABAA receptors. Once GABA attaches, the pore formed by the subunits opens, and chloride ions flow across the cell membrane. After infancy, chloride ions flow into the cell through the open pore, which creates an environment in the cell that blocks (inhibits) signaling between neurons. The primary role of GABA in children and adults is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. In contrast, in newborns and infants, chloride ions flow out of the cell when the pore is opened, creating an environment that allows signaling between neuro

Glutamate receptors are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal neurophysiologic processes.

The classification of glutamate receptors is based on their activation by different pharmacologic agonists. The subunit encoded by this gene belongs to a family of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate)-sensitive glutamate receptors, and is subject to RNA editing (AGA->GGA; R->G). Alternative splicing at this locus results in different isoforms, which may vary in their signal transduction properties. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

Receptor for glutamate that functions as ligand-gated ion channel in the central nervous system and plays an important role in excitatory synaptic transmission. L-glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central nervous system. Binding of the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate induces a conformation change, leading to the opening of the cation channel, and thereby converts the chemical signal to an electrical impulse. The receptor then desensitizes rapidly and enters a transient inactive state, characterized by the presence of bound agonist. In the presence of CACNG4 or CACNG7 or CACNG8, shows resensitization which is characterized by a delayed accumulation of current flux upon continued application of glutamate.

Normal Function<br>

The SLC1A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1). EAAT1 transports a molecule called glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is one of several brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which allow nerve cells (neurons) to communicate with one another. EAAT1 is found throughout the brain, but it is most abundant in the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem) and the region of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum).
Neurotransmitters (such as glutamate) are released from neurons and relay signals to other cells by attaching to receptor proteins on neighboring neurons. After the neurotransmitters have had their effect, they detach from their receptors and must be cleared from the spaces between neurons. Researchers have determined that EAAT1 is one of several glutamate transporters that clear excess glutamate from these spaces. This process is carefully regulated to ensure that signals are transmitted accurately throughout the nervous system. The timely removal of glutamate is also necessary to prevent a buildup of this neurotransmitter between cells, which would be toxic to neurons.

The ASNS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called asparagine synthetase. This enzyme is found in cells throughout the body, where it converts the protein building block (amino acid) aspartic acid to the amino acid asparagine. Another amino acid called glutamine helps in the conversion and is itself converted to the amino acid glutamic acid during the process. It is thought that asparagine synthetase helps to maintain the normal balance of these four amino acids in the body.
Asparagine is needed to produce many proteins but also plays other roles. Asparagine helps to break down toxic ammonia within cells, is important for protein modification, and is needed for making a certain molecule that transmits signals in the brain (a neurotransmitter).
Although asparagine can be obtained through the diet, the amino acid cannot cross the protective barrier that allows only certain substances to pass between blood vessels and the brain (the blood-brain barrier). As a result, brain cells rely solely on asparagine synthetase to produce asparagine.

Normal Function<br>

From NCBI Gene:
The protein encoded by this gene is a type I transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein (TARP). TARPs regulate both trafficking and channel gating of the AMPA receptors. The AMPA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand gated ion channels that are typically activated by glutamate released from presynaptic neuron terminals and mediate fast neurotransmission in excitatory synapses. TARPs thus play an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Mutations in this gene cause an autosomal dominant form of cognitive disability. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2017]
From UniProt:
Regulates the trafficking and gating properties of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Promotes their targeting to the cell membrane and synapses and modulates their gating properties by slowing their rates of activation, deactivation and desensitization. Does not show subunit-specific AMPA receptor regulation and regulates all AMPAR subunits. Thought to stabilize the calcium channel in an inactivated (closed) state.

gamma-glutamyl carboxylase
that carboxylates glutamate residues of vitamin K-dependent proteins to gamma carboxyl glutamate, a modification that is required for their activity. Vitamin K-dependent proteins affect a number of physiologic processes including blood coagulation, prevention of vascular calcification, and inflammation

From NCBI Gene:
This gene encodes an integral membrane protein of the rough endoplasmic reticulum that carboxylates glutamate residues of vitamin K-dependent proteins to gamma carboxyl glutamate, a modification that is required for their activity. The vitamin K-dependent protein substrates have a propeptide that binds the enzyme, with carbon dioxide, dioxide, and reduced vitamin K acting as co-substrates. Vitamin K-dependent proteins affect a number of physiologic processes including blood coagulation, prevention of vascular calcification, and inflammation. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like disorder with associated multiple coagulation factor deficiency. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2015]
From UniProt:
Mediates the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamate residues to calcium-binding gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues with the concomitant conversion of the reduced hydroquinone form of vitamin K to vitamin K epoxide.

Normal Function<br>

From NCBI Gene:
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the glutamine synthetase family. It catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia in an ATP-dependent reaction. This protein plays a role in ammonia and glutamate detoxification, acid-base homeostasis, cell signaling, and cell proliferation. Glutamine is an abundant amino acid, and is important to the biosynthesis of several amino acids, pyrimidines, and purines. Mutations in this gene are associated with congenital glutamine deficiency, and overexpression of this gene was observed in some primary liver cancer samples. There are six pseudogenes of this gene found on chromosomes 2, 5, 9, 11, and 12. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2014]
From UniProt:
Glutamine synthetase that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine (PubMed:30158707, PubMed:16267323). Its role depends on tissue localization: in the brain, it regulates the levels of toxic ammonia and converts neurotoxic glutamate to harmless glutamine, whereas in the liver, it is one of the enzymes responsible for the removal of ammonia (By similarity). Essential for proliferation of fetal skin fibroblasts (PubMed:18662667). Independently of its glutamine synthetase activity, required for endothelial cell migration during vascular development: acts by regulating membrane localization and activation of the GTPase RHOJ, possibly by promoting RHOJ palmitoylation (PubMed:30158707). May act as a palmitoyltransferase for RHOJ: able to autopalmitoylate and then transfer the palmitoyl group to RHOJ (PubMed:30158707)

Normal Function<br>

The FTCD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase. This enzyme is found mainly in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys. In males it is also found in the testes.
Formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase is called a bifunctional enzyme because it performs two functions. Specifically, it is involved in the last two steps in the breakdown (metabolism) of the amino acid histidine, a building block of most proteins. It also plays a role in producing one of several forms of the vitamin folate, which has many important functions in the body.
One of the enzyme's functions, called formiminotransferase, breaks down a molecule called N-formiminoglutamate in the process of histidine metabolism. Part of the N-formiminoglutamate molecule, called the formimino group, is incorporated into another molecule called formiminotetrahydrofolate. The amino acid glutamate is also produced in this reaction.
The second function of the enzyme, called cyclodeaminase, breaks down formiminotetrahydrofolate to a molecule called 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and ammonia. 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate is one of several tetrahydrofolate molecules involved in the production (synthesis) of many important molecules in the body, such as purines and pyrimidines (the building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA) and amino acids. The tetrahydrofolates carry small molecules called one-carbon units that are needed for the synthesis of these larger molecules.
