<u><b>KRAS gene</u></b>
 <br>
KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase


<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 12p12.1, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 12 at position 12.1
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 25,204,789 to 25,251,003 on chromosome 12 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 
<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The KRAS gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The KRAS gene is in the Ras family of oncogenes, which also includes two other genes: HRAS and NRAS. These proteins play important roles in cell division, cell differentiation, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).

<u><b>SFTPB gene</u></b>
surfactant protein B

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 2p11.2, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 2 at position 11.2
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 85,657,317 to 85,668,741 on chromosome 2 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) 
<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The SFTPB gene provides instructions for making a protein called surfactant protein-B (SP-B). This protein is one of four proteins (each produced from a different gene) in surfactant, a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. The SP-B protein helps spread the surfactant across the surface of the lung tissue, aiding in the surface tension-lowering property of surfactant.

<u><b>TERC gene</u></b>
telomerase RNA component
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 3q26.2, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position 26.2
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 169,764,610 to 169,765,060 on chromosome 3 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

<u><b>EGFR gene</u></b>
epidermal growth factor receptor
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 7p11.2, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 7 at position 11.2
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 55,019,021 to 55,208,080 on chromosome 7 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The EGFR gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor, which spans the cell membrane so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. The binding of a ligand to epidermal growth factor receptor allows the receptor to attach to another nearby epidermal growth factor receptor protein (dimerize), turning on (activating) the receptor complex. As a result, signaling pathways within the cell are triggered that promote cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. 

<u><b>SFTPC gene</u></b>
<br>
surfactant protein C

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 8p21.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 8 at position 21.3
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 22,161,671 to 22,164,479 on chromosome 8 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The SFTPC gene provides instructions for making a protein called surfactant protein-C (SP-C). This protein is one of four proteins (each produced from a different gene) in surfactant, a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. The SP-C protein helps spread the surfactant across the surface of the lung tissue, aiding in the surface tension-lowering property of surfactant.

SLC34A2 gene
solute carrier family 34 member 2
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 4p15.2, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 at position 15.2
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 25,655,813 to 25,678,748 on chromosome 4 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The SLC34A2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the type IIb sodium-phosphate cotransporter, which plays a role in the regulation of phosphate levels (phosphate homeostasis). Although this protein can be found in several organs and tissues in the body, it is located mainly in the millions of small air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, specifically in cells called alveolar type II cells. These cells produce and recycle surfactant, which is a mixture of certain phosphate-containing fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy.

The ABCA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in surfactant production. Surfactant is a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy.

<u><b>SCGB3A2 gene</u></b>
secretoglobin family 3A member 2

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 5q32, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position 32
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 147,878,711 to 147,882,193 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)
<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted lung surfactant protein and a downstream target of thyroid transcription factor. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of this gene results in susceptibility to asthma. 

<u><b>TP53 gene</u></b>
tumor protein p53

<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 17p13.1, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 at position 13.1
<br><br>Molecular Location : 
<br> base pairs 7,668,402 to 7,687,550 on chromosome 17 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI)

<br><br>Normal Function : 
<br>

The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor protein p53 (or p53). This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it regulates cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Because p53 is essential for regulating cell division and preventing tumor formation, it has been nicknamed the "guardian of the genome."

From NCBI Gene:</u></b>
The protein encoded by this gene may regulate muscle-specific genes when in the nucleus and may influence intracellular trafficking when in the cytoplasm. The encoded protein functions as a homodimer and may interact with F actin. Mutations in this gene are associated with lung cancer. May play a role in the control of tumor development and progression; restored MYO18B expression in lung cancer cells suppresses anchorage-independent growth.

<u><b>FOXF1 gene</u></b>
forkhead box F1
<br><br>Cytogenetic Location : 
<br> 16q24.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 16 at position 24.1

The FOXF1 gene provides instructions for making the forkhead box F1 (FOXF1) protein. The FOXF1 protein is important in the development of pulmonary mesenchyme, the embryonic tissue from which blood vessels of the lung arise. It is also involved in the development of the gastrointestinal tract.
